# Development Guidelines

## Branching
- Do not commit directly to master!
- When beginning work on a new feature, you should create a personal branch off of master.  
- When you are done, you should create a pull request to merge your changes into master.  
- Once your pull request is approved by the other developers, your changes will be merged in the master branch.
